## **Project Overview**

This project involves creating and managing a company-managed Kanban board in Jira. The board will evolve through different versions, incorporating various Agile practices.

### **Versions and Requirements**

| Version | Requirement Summary                                   | Verification Steps                                       |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **A**   | Create a Kanban project with columns: Backlog, Selected for Development, In Progress, Done | Verify that issues move across columns correctly        |
| **B**   | Set WIP limit for "In Progress" to 3 items            | Verify that exceeding the limit turns the column red    |
| **C**   | Create a backlog separate from the board              | Verify backlog is hidden when viewing the board         |
| **D**   | Split "In Progress" into Analyze, Build, and Verify columns. Set WIP limit of 3 for "Build" | Ensure issues can flow through these columns as expected|
| **E**   | Add a swimlane named Expedite for high-priority issues | Verify high-priority issues appear in the swimlane      |
| **F**   | Create an epic named Initial Release and add issues   | Ensure epic label is visible on board issues            |
| **G**   | Create a filter to display open issues from Initial Release | Ensure only non-done issues of the epic are displayed   |
| **H**   | Move all issues to Done and release version 0.1       | Verify that no released issues appear on the board      |
| **I**   | Explore additional Jira features                      | Document any explored features                          |
